## RGB Bipyramid

Initial version was done in AS3/Flex when I had interests in 3D. Drag to rotate. Scroll/zoom to change the depth of field.

## Node Garden

Basic points with velocity and virtual weights. Tap the screen to change between thee modes: debug, line art and point art. Scoll/zoom to change the velocity.

## Shader

Colour warp. Parameters change with mouse position. Left = high saturation, right = low saturation, top = bright, bottom = dark. Click the mouse to shift the hue. (Saturation is also inverted per pixel.)

## Flower

100 petals growing outwards. Each changing slightly over time.
